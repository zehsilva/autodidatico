## Bayesian Machine Learning / Probabilistic models in ML / Bayesian Deep Learning / Statistics and probability

This one will be hard to organize because there is many years of studying the field. So it will tend to have either things I learned many years ago and generated some written content that I want to put in the same place, or new things I am learning at the moment or have interest in learning more.
