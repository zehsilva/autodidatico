- Gauge Equivariant Convolutional Networks and the Icosahedral CNN http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/cohen19d/cohen19d.pdf

### Flows and geometry
- Multi-chart flows https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03500.pdf


## Notes
- Both Gauge Equivariant and Multi-chart flows use similar techniques of charting the manifold and looking for a way to use models as mapping to the chart of the landspace. Worth investigating that further.
