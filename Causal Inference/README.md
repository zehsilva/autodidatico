# Causal Inference / Causality


## What I want to get from this topic
- Pretty much learn all I can possibly learn from the computational and statistical point of view
- Acquire basic understanding of the philosophy literature on the subject matter
- Find intersections and exclusive takes on the subject matter from physics and econometrics, maybe cross-fertilize there
