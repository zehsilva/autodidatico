# autodidatico
reposity to track my learning of different topics. Each folder will have a broad topic of interest and documents (.md, notebooks and pdfs)

- Notebooks:
  - Reparameterization and gradient estimators for variational inference (UIVI, SIVI): [notebook](https://github.com/zehsilva/autodidatico/blob/main/machine%20learning%20and%20statistics/variational%20inference%20foundations/implicit_vi.ipynb) and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1znA-K9F4C7Rp-uN13wFb9daHfzmdDRas?usp=sharing)

## how can you help
- Reach out: on twitter [@zeh_silva](https://twitter.com/zeh_silva), via PR (for example if you want to start a shared document were we learn things together), issues or email.
- Ask me questions and challenge me to:
  - Clarify or explain concepts
  - Explain how two things are similar or different
  - Explain how something can be applied in ML / CS / Stats
  - Explain the process how something is constructed
- Hold me accountable to finish the deliverables that I agreed on (even if in private). This project is supposed to be neverending, although I imagine at some point the rate of engagement will decrease or change to other mediums. It will all depend on how engaging this will be (and with this I mean the whole job of reading, learning, reporting and keeping track of it, so far I have mostly just done reading and thinking that I learn + some sparsed note taking).


## how can I help you
- If you are in a similar self-learning journey, even if our topic doesn't match completely, I might be interested in doing some dive in the topics you are interested. Also if you need accountable buddies to work together and grow together.
- If there is some paper related to the areas listed here and machine learning that you would want to dive in to understand and re-implement / experiment, I am always potentially interested in that.
