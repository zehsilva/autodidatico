# autodidatico
reposity to track my learning of different topics. Each folder will have a broad topic of interest and documents (.md, notebooks and pdfs)

## how can you help
- Reach out: on twitter [@zeh_silva](https://twitter.com/zeh_silva), via PR (for example if you want to start a shared document were we learn things together), issues or email.
- Ask me questions and challenge me to:
  - Clarify or explain concepts
  - Explain how two things are similar or different
  - Explain how something can be applied in ML / CS / Stats
  - Explain the process how something is constructed
- Hold me accountable to finish the deliverables that I agreed on (even if in private). This project is supposed to be neverending, although I imagine at some point the rate of engagement will decrease or change to other mediums. It will all depend on how engaging this will be (and with this I mean the whole job of reading, learning, reporting and keeping track of it, so far I have mostly just done reading and thinking that I learn + some sparsed note taking).
