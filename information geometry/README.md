# Information Geometry


## What I want to get from this topic
- Acquire a higher command of branch of mathematics and statistics that is relevant for my lont term deep understanding of learning system
- More focused on Bayesian Modeling, acquire technical skills to deal with reparameterizaton in a principled way
- Entry point to learn more differential geometry
- Be comfortable designing model that incorporate notions from differential geometry and information geometry
- Follow intuitively the up-to-date literature
